<p>Speed, Quality, Dev Time... pick two. This has been an age-old tradeoff in software development. This blog post is about how to maximize this tradeoff in a machine learning context.</p>

<blockquote>Make it work... then make it fast... then make it beautiful -- Matthew Russell</blockquote>

<p>Speed has traditionally been accomplished by either scaling up to many machines (cluster computing) or threading up on one machine (GPU computing). </p>

<p>Quality, in my opinion, is most catalyzed through excelent tooling allowing visibility into code both at devtime and runtime. When dealing with large amounts of code, this is catalyzed through IDEs. When dealing with small amounts of code (such as a machine learning prototype), I find that iPython notebooks are exceptional tools for rapidly playing with ideas.

Dev time is most catalyzed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine#Flux_capacitor">flux-capacitors</a>. </p>





<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
